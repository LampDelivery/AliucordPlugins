# AliucordPlugins

hi

## CompactLinks
Compacts links like DiscordRN **(MoreHighlight is required until its core)**

## CopyLinks
Copy channel links from the context menu

## AtPrefixProfiles
Adds an @ as a prefix to usernames in profiles (also the settings)

## MessageTimestamps
Configure the message timestamps

## ChannelBrowser (BETA)
Manage your channel list from a menu sheet, show/hide channels and follow/unfollow categories
Planning to merge into core, which is why I am not releasing it as a normal plugin
As of writing this it only syncs changes from one direction (Aliucord -> PC/RN), so beware.

## DebugLogEnhancer
Replaces discord debug logs with a new page that supports filters, search and more
